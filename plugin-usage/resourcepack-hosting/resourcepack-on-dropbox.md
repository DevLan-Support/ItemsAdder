# HÃ©berger le ressourepack sur Dropbox

## How to upload your resourcepack to DropBox

{% hint style="danger" %}
**DO NOT USE** MY **pack\_21521367.zip** EXAMPLE AS BASE!!!!  
YOU HAVE TO USE THE **pack.zip** FILE WHICH IS GENERATED AFTER **/iazip** COMMAND.  
You can find it here: `plugins/ItemsAdder/data/resource_pack/`
{% endhint %}

One of the most famous is DropBox. It allows you to publish your files for free and it's really easy and fast.  
You just have to:

* Open [DropBox](https://dropbox.com/), register/login
* Open folder: `plugins/ItemsAdder/data/resource_pack/`
* Be sure you used command ****`/iazip` \(it's important because `/iazip`reloads the configs, updates the **pack.zip** file\)
* Drag and drop on **DropBox** the file **pack.zip**
* Press **Share**

* Press **Create link**

* Press **Copy link**
* For example if your link is [https://www.dropbox.com/blablabla?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/blablabla?dl=0) 
* Open `config.yml` of **ItemsAdder**
* Set it like this \(**I used the example URL, please use your own**\)

```yaml
resource-pack:
  apply-on-join: true
  kick-player-on-decline: false
  delay-ticks: 1
  self-host:
    enabled: false
    server-ip: '127.0.0.1'
    pack-port: 8163
  external-host:
    enabled: true
    url: 'https://www.dropbox.com/blablabla?raw=1'
```

* **THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT**: **Use command** `/iareload` to reload configs \(in this case to reload the resourcepack download link\)
* **Use command** `/iatexture` on your game to refresh your texture ingame or use `/iatexture all` to refresh it for every player

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not forget to use `/iazip` **everytime** you edit a **texture**, a 3D **model**, a **sound**... then **reupload** the pack on **Dropbox** and use **/iareload** or you won't see any change obviously.
