# De base

### Enabled

```yaml
enabled: true
```

With this setting you can disable an item completely.  
**Obviously if a player has it in inventory it won't be removed, he still will own it.  
Same thing for blocks, but when broken they won't drop anymore**

### Display name

```yaml
display_name: "Test"
```

This is the name user will see on the item

### Permission

```yaml
permission: myitem
```

{% page-ref page="item-permission.md" %}

### Lore

```yaml
lore:
- '&7When you mine a block'
- '&7it drops exp orbs'
- '&750% of times.'
```

Lore lines of the item

### Attribute modifiers

```yaml
attribute_modifiers:
  list:
    mainhand:
      attackDamage: 19
      attackSpeed: 1.1
      maxHealth: 1.1
      movementSpeed: -1
      armor: 1.1
      armorToughness: 1.1
      attackKnockback: 1.1
      luck: 1.1
    offhand:
      attackDamage: 19
      attackSpeed: 1.1
      maxHealth: 1.1
      movementSpeed: 1.1
      armor: 1.1
      armorToughness: 1.1
      attackKnockback: 1.1
      luck: 1.1
```

These are the vanilla attribute modifiers, you can get more info here [https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Attribute\#Attributes\_available\_on\_all\_living\_entities](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Attribute#Attributes_available_on_all_living_entities)

### Durability

```yaml
durability:
  max_custom_durability: 200
  custom_durability: 32
  disappear_when_broken: false
  unbreakable: false
  usages: 5
```

There are pretty self explanatory.  
`usages` are a special propery which allows you to set a number of usages for the current item. Remember to decrement it using events \(check events tutorial\).

`custom_durability` is the durability amount which the item has on crafting \(if not specified is the same as `max_custom_durability`\)

`max_custom_durability` is the max durability the item can reach

### Item flags

```yaml
item_flags:
  - HIDE_ATTRIBUTES
  - HIDE_DESTROYS
  - HIDE_ENCHANTS
  - HIDE_PLACED_ON
  - HIDE_POTION_EFFECTS
  - HIDE_UNBREAKABLE
```

Special item flags that can hide some vanilla info of the item.
