# Comportements

## What are behaviours?

Behaviours are an **already coded** set of **actions** the item will do and which are **not vanilla**.  
These **behaviours** are already included in the plugin and will allow you to add some already coded functionality to your item.

### List of behaviours included in the plugin

* block\_trade\_machine
* furniture\_trade\_machine
* furniture
* furniture\_sit
* gun
* hat
* music\_disc
* vehicle
