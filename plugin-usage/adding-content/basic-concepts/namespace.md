# Espace de noms

## Namespace

As you surely noticed ItemsAdder uses **namespaces** to identify most of the things it manages.  
A **namespace** is like a **group** of elements you the plugin can easly understand where a particular item, sound, blocks.. comes from.

### Example

All magic items are under the **realcraft** namespace, so when you use the `/iaget` command you can see all items IDs start with `realcraft:`

Surely now that you see how it works you want to ask me this question.  
To define your own namespace \(you can also define multiple ones!\) it's really easy:
