# Blocks drop mushrooms

If you have this problem please read here **before asking for support**:

## First reason

If you have [EmeraldEnchants2 ](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/EmeraldEnchants2)installed [read this](https://github.com/LoneDev6/ItemsAdder/issues/123)

## Second reason

Did you delete the ItemsAdder plugin folder? Don't do it. It contains world data under: `plugins\ItemsAdder\storage\regions_data`

If you delete it you lose every custom ItemsAdder block data in the world.

## Third reason

Corrupted chunk. This can happen if you:

* killed the server while it was saving an IA region file
* full disk problem which blocked saving of files
